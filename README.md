## Gravity: Planetary Orbital Motion
Given how most astronomical systems are far beyond our reach, we often need to turn to models and simulations in order to verify our predictions about theories. This simulation is a simplified version of the ones used to predict the long-term behaviour of comets and asteroids, which may pose potential hazards to earth.
