# Science-Python-Projects
Python projects for educational purposes. The difficulty rating considers both the prerequisite knowledge needed, as well as the level of computational thinking required. The goal is for the student to learn more about python applications, as well as some interesting science

Arranged in order of increasing difficulty.
